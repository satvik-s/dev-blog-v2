I relish a lot of aspects of engineering. One of them is thinking about the
infrastructure. When I heard of AWS CDK, it sounded intriguing. I had used Terraform
before. Although I never got the hang of the syntax, I liked the concept of
infrastructure as code and wanted to explore how AWS CDK was trying to approach it.

Integrating the Spotify Now Playing footer onto my blog was the perfect opportunity for that.
Existing examples that I drew inspiration from like [leerob.io](https://leerob.io/) and
[thvu.dev](https://www.thvu.dev/) used front-end exclusively to create Spotify API wrappers but
I gravitated towards an over-engineered solution to try out CDK.

It took me a few hours to figure out the right approach to make the HTTP API instead of
the conventional REST API because fewer examples were available. Disregarding that, it
has overall been a great experience to see infrastructure be so easily deployable and
code controlled. I will highly recommend looking at CDK the next time there is a need to
deploy infrastructure.

Here is my GitHub repository for the same: https://github.com/satvik-s/spotify-lambda
