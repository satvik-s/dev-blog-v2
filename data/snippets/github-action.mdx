## Usage

<Step number={1} title="Build the project" />

Update the steps in the above action to build the project. The above
example builds an `npm` project but it would be needed to swap the steps
to build non-`npm` projects

<Step number={2} title="Update folder name" />

Update the name of the folder/file whose size should be included in the PR.
Requires updating the `folder` in the `name: Set build size` step

And that should be it. You should now see the the PR commenting
the size of the folder/file you wanted to be included.
